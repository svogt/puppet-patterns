Puppet patterns
===============

This is a small collection of samples for common Puppet use cases.

As I was frustrated that I couldn't find examples for a bunch of (from my POV) 
easy use cases I started this repository. Feel free to fork and send pull 
requests if you have easier ways to do the things. Use manifests/default.pp as 
a starting point. Each include there represents one common use case.
